        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Step 1</h2>
        <h3>First gather the tools required to build your PC.
            screwdrivers such as the flat head and the phillips head.Scissors and a craft knife (box cutter) for opening packaging.
Cable ties and wire cutters to trim them, or you can use twist ties.
A rubbish bin.
A lamp if you're working at night.
A magnetic dish or any sort of organising system to keep track of screws.MAKE SURE TO BE SAFE BY TURNING OFF THE POWER SOURCE.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Step 2</h2>
<div>
<h3>Firstly use the screwdrivers to unscrew the side cover of the case of the PC.</h3>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>step 3</h2>
<h3>Then screw in the motherboard standoffs into the case and then fasten the motherboard in place on top of the mounting standoffs.</h3>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Step 4</h2>
<h3>Then locate the cpu socket holder on the motherboard and then by holding the cpu from the sides and gently place it straight down into the motherboard socket and lower the latch onto the cpu to keep it in place and from falling.</h3>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Step 5</h2>
<h3>Next seat the CPU heatsink/cooler and fix it in position.Then plug the power cable attached to the cooler into the motherboard connector</h3>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Step 6</h2>
<h3>Now mount the power supply and fasten with screws to the case with mounting points.Plug the largest cablling connector from the power supply cabling into the motherboard power connector.Then plug the 8-pin cabling connector from the poower supply cabling into the CPU power connector.</h3>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Step 7</h2>
<h3>Now press the button on both the ends of the RAM mounting slots.Then line up the notch on the RAM stick with the mounting slot.Seat the RAM and press it firmly down into the slot.The tabs should automatuically latch as you press the RAM down securing it in place.You may install other RAM stick using the same method.</h3>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Step 8</h2>
<h3>Next we will work on the Graphics Card.First remove the expansion slot covers from the rear of your case where the graphics card will sit.The graphics card slots into a PCI expansion slot on the lower half of the motherboard.Line it up and press down firmly to seat the card.Put the screws in to keep the card in place.Plug the power connector cables from your power supply into your graphics card power connecter.(if existing as not all graphics card need a power source)</h3>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Step 9</h2>
<h3>Mounting storage drives,first mount the storage drives in the case drive bays.Then fix the drives in place with screws into the case mounting holes.Then connect the drive to the motherboard using SATA cable.Now plug in power cabling to the storage drive.Mount any other storage drives in the same ways.</h3>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Step 10</h2>
<h3>Mounting optical drive,first remove any front panels from the computer case where the optical drive will fit.Then remove any front panels from the computer case where the optical drive will sit. Mount optical drive in the case by fixing with screws through the case frame into the case.Mounting holes located on the optical drive connect the optical drive to the motherboard using a SATA cable plug in power cabling from your power supply to the optical drive.</h3>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Step 11</h2>
<h3>Connecting the case fans and front panel connectors.Firstly mount any case fans within your case as required using the supplied screws or clips.Now connect any case fan power connectors to the multiple fan headers located at various places on the motherboard.Next identify the cabling from the front panel ports of your PC.These front panel connectors will need to be plugged into the motherboard so that buttons and inputs/outputs (1/0) on your case front panel will work.</h3>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
